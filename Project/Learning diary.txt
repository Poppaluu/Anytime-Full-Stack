That package of 4 videos was quite something. The backend is quite easy and I could do it without breaking my brain.
redux on the other hand was somethign ive never even heard of and the syntax of it was quite hard.
at least for someone seeing it for the first time. I dont think ive used axios either but that was fun.
I think I understand some of the redux now that I did some implementations of my own but still needed some help from
AI tools on the Component which now looks quite funky but works :D.
definately learned a lot during these two weeks that I did this course in. quite long days those were.
there is something in learning by watching videos and copying code form the video that gets quite repetetive
at some point. I also was quite tired at some points where I was still watching the videos and doing this course at 8pm.
I now understand better the structure of full stack applications and this is valuable experience for getting work at some point.

That proxy came back to haunt me. I remember on the advanced webapplications course that the proxy didnt work and sure enough it didnt work this time either.
I just put the whole address into the API variable(which is not recommended for security reasons but this is a localhost environment so whats the worst that could happen right)
