Learned more about express. Learned how to use and what is a static express load.
Created a couple of middlewares to ease the use of reoccurring code.
created error handilng middleware. 
This lecture has been more of what I remember the full stack course being. The ES6 usage and separate files for routes and such.
cant wait to add react on top of this.
