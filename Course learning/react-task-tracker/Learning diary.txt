This was definately the hardest of the courses so far. so much more was given during the lectures and these subjects were harder to wrap my head around
after playing with the functions a little myself, I think I have it down better than before the course.
I remember doing these in the other full stack course with the front end and back end servers being different which is something that 
was re introduced to me during this course which was nice. I really think that this could have benefitted from having mongoose in it
as I dont think that Static data is something that is commonly used writte on a file somewhere in the structure but I might be wrong
I also like playing with the databases and gives the whole thing a little more sense atleast thats what I think as you only need
to update the database.
