I have (re)learned how to use the postman with GET and POST methods. I have also learned the basics of creating a web server with Node js.
Node js is not the best possible option when used alone but as I go further along with the lectures, I will bring back to memory the
mongo DB, express, and react which will greatly ease my work.
So far I have just written everything that the video has shown me, but I have tried the things that he has mentioned and some things that have come up for me.
