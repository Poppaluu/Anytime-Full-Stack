I have (re)learned how to use the postman with GET and POST methods. I have also learned the basics of creating a web server with Node js.
Node js is not the best possible option when used alone but as I go further along with the lectures, I will bring back to memory the
mongo DB, express, and react which will greatly ease my work.
So far I have just written everything that the video has shown me, but I have tried the things that he has mentioned and some things that have come up for me.
In the end, I remembered using some of these in my other course for full stack coding, but a lot had already been lost in a yaer.
Some of these were completely new to me as our previous course only went through the most common ones and went with the best methods, but this
course gave me options to use, but I still prefer the tools used in my previous express and node courses.
this video tutorial went through the basic tools of Node js and I think they will probably be useful in some situation in a point of time.
Cant wait for the next lecture which is about mongoDB
