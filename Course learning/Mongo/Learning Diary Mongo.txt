I didn't feel like going through the commandline mongo db tutorial so I just brought back into mind the basics of express and creating a mongo server
Instead of using the cloud version I hosted the server on my computer, which is something that i was already used to.
I had some help with setting this up by github copilot.
I got a little carried away with testing out the mongo and created a simple html that fetches and sends data to the mongoDB server.
Overall, I started to remember how to use express and paths and node js and mongo together.
In no way did this become the most cleanest version I could do but it was created quite fast. I remember doing these things a little differently
during the other full stack course. I hope I get a little clearer picture from the express lecture.
