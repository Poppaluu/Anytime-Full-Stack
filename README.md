# Anytime-Full-Stack

Matias Tarvainen

A course repository for the project, learning diary, and learning examples

To use any of these project on your own machine:

1. go to the same directory that a package.json is in and write npm install. this will install all the needed packages
2. I used the mongo desktop version and you should set that up so that the connection to the database is possible
3. open your browser if it has not opened automatically and go to http://localhost:5000/ for the backend and http://localhost:3000/ for the frontend

heres the video to the showcasing of the project: [text](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knmTvoFen9I&ab_channel=matiastarvainen)
